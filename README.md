# Introduction
This is a fun and educational word spelling game designed to test your spelling skills. The game consists of three levels of difficulty with different genres of words.

Getting Started

Simply load the site and create an account. Once you have created an account, you can log in and start playing.

How to Play

Once you have logged in, select the level of difficulty and genre of words you want to play with. The game will then start, and you will be given a word to spell via an audio cue. Listen carefully to the word and type it in the input field provided. If you spell the word correctly, you will earn points. The more words you spell correctly in a row, the higher your score will be. If you spell multiple words correctly in a row, you go on a streak. Once you get a word incorrect, you lose your streak. Once all the words are completed, you are given a score at the end.

Leaderboard

The top scores of all players are displayed on the leaderboard. You can also search for any other user's top score using the search bar.
