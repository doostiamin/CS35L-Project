# Server

This project uses NodeJS as its backend. After cloning this project into your local environment, use the following instructions in order to get the server up and going

```shell
# change directory to the server folder
cd server

# install all the dependencies needed for this project
npm i

# for development (uses 'nodemon' instead of 'node' to run)

# for production
npm run prod
```

The server will start on port `8080` and you will see the following message print out to the command line: `listening on port 8080`
